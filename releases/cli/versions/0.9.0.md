## Major file update improvements üìÑ
- Much better accuracy for updates to existing files.
- Planto is much less likely to screw up braces, parentheses, and other code structures.
- Planto is much less likely to mistakenly remove code that it shouldn't.

## Major improvements to long plans with many steps üõ§Ô∏è
- Planto's 'working memory' has been upgraded. It is now much better at working through very long plans without skipping tasks, repeating tasks it's already done, or otherwise losing track of what it's doing.

## 'planto diff' command ‚öñÔ∏è

- New `planto diff` command shows pending plan changes in `git diff` format.

## Plans can be archived üóÑÔ∏è

- If you aren't using a plan anymore, but you don't want to delete it, you can now archive it.
- Use `planto archive` (or `planto arc` for short) to archive a plan.
- Use `planto plans --archived` (or `planto plans -a`) to see archived plans in the current directory.
- Use `planto unarchive` (or `planto unarc`) to restore an archived plan.

## Custom models!! üß†
### Use Planto with models from OpenRouter, Together.ai, and more

![planto-models](https://github.com/planto-ai/planto/blob/03263a83d76785846fd472693aed03d36a68b86c/releases/images/cli/0.9.0/planto-models.gif)

- Use `planto models add` to add a custom model and use any provider that is compatible with OpenAI, including OpenRouter.ai, Together.ai, Ollama, Replicate, and more.
- Anthropic Claude models are available via OpenRouter.ai. Google Gemini 1.5 preview is also available on OpenRouter.ai but was flakey in initial testing. Tons of open source models are available on both OpenRouter.ai and Together.ai, among other providers.
- Some built-in models and model packs (see 'Model packs' below) have been included as a quick way to try out a few of the more powerful model options. Just use `planto set-model` to try these.
- You can use a custom model you've added with `planto set-model`, or add it to a model pack (see 'Model packs' below) with `planto model-packs create`. Delete custom models you've added with `planto models delete`.
- The roles a custom model can be used for depend on its OpenAI compatibility.
- Each model provider has an `ApiKeyEnvVar` associated with it, like `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, etc. You will need to have the appropriate environment variables set with a valid api key for each provider that you're using.
- Because all of Planto's prompts have been tested against OpenAI models, support for new models should be considered **experimental**.
- If you find prompting patterns that are effective for certain models, please share them on Discord (https://discord.gg/planto-ai) or GitHub (https://github.com/planto-ai/planto/discussions) and they may be included in future releases.

## Model packs üéõÔ∏è
- Instead of changing models for each role one by one, a model packs let you switch out all roles at once.
- Use `planto model-packs create` qto create your own model packs. 
- Use `planto model-packs` to list built-in and custom model packs. 
- Use `planto set-model` to load a model pack.
- Use `planto model-packs delete` to remove a custom model pack.

## Model defaults ‚öôÔ∏è
- Instead of only changing models on a per-plan basis, you can set model defaults that will apply to all new plans you start.
- Use `planto models default` to see default model settings and `planto set-model default` to update them. 

## More commands üíª
- `planto summary` to see the latest plan summary
- `planto rename` to rename the current plan

## Quality of life improvements üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- Descriptive top-line for `planto apply` commit messages instead of just "applied pending changes".

- Better message in `planto log` when a single piece of context is loaded or updated.
- Abbreviate really long file paths in `planto ls`.
- Changed `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` env var to `OPENAI_API_BASE`, which is more standardized. OPENAI_ENDPOINT is still quietly supported.
- guides/ENV_VARS.md now lists environment variables you can use with Planto (and a few convenience varaiables have been addded) - thanks @knno! ‚Üí https://github.com/planto-ai/planto/pull/94

## Bug fixes üêû
- Fix for potential crash in `planto changes` TUI.
- Fixes for some rare potential deadlocks and conflicts when building a file or stopping a plan stream.
