- Give notes added to context with `planto load -n 'some note'` automatically generated names in `context ls` list.
- Fixes for summarization and auto-continue issues that could Planto to lose track of where it is in the plan and repeat tasks or do tasks out of order, especially when using `tell` and `continue` after the initial `tell`.
- Improvements to the verification and auto-fix step. Planto is now more likely to catch and fix placeholder references like "// ... existing code ..." as well as incorrect removal or overwriting of code.
- After a context file is updated, Planto is less likely to use an old version of the code from earlier in the conversation--it now uses the latest version much more reliably.
- Increase wait times when receiving rate limit errors from OpenAI API (common with new OpenAI accounts that haven't spent $50).
