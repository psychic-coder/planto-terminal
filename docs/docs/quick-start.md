# Quickstart

## Install Planto

```bash
curl -sL https://planto.ai/install.sh | bash
```

[Click here for more installation options.](./install.md)

Note that Windows is supported via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Planto only works correctly on Windows in the WSL shell. It doesn't work in the Windows CMD prompt or PowerShell.

## Hosting Options

| Option                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planto Cloud (Integrated Models)** | • No separate accounts or API keys.<br/>• Easy multi-device usage.<br/>• Centralized billing, budgeting, usage tracking, and cost reporting.<br/>• Quickest way to [get started.](https://app.planto.ai/start?modelsMode=integrated)                                                        |
| **Planto Cloud (BYO API Key)**       | • Use Planto Cloud with your own [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) key (and **optionally** your own [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) key).<br/>                                                                                                                               |
| **Self-hosted/Local Mode**            | • Run Planto locally with Docker or host on your own server.<br/>• Use your own [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) (and **optionally** your own [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) key).<br/>• Follow the [local-mode quickstart](./hosting/self-hosting/local-mode-quickstart.md) to get started. |

If you're going with a 'BYO API Key' option above (whether cloud or self-hosted), and you don't have an OpenRouter account, first [sign up here.](https://openrouter.ai/signup) Then [generate an API key here.](https://openrouter.ai/keys) Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
```

You can also **optionally** set a `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if you want OpenAI models to use the OpenAI API directly instead of OpenRouter (for slightly lower latency and costs). This requires an [OpenAI account.](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

## Get Started

If you're starting on a new project, make a directory first:

```bash
mkdir your-project-dir
```

Now `cd` into your **project's directory.**

```bash
cd your-project-dir
```

Then just give a quick the REPL help text a quick read, and you're ready go. The REPL starts in _chat mode_ by default, which is good for fleshing out ideas before moving to implementation. Once the task is clear, Planto will prompt you to switch to _tell mode_ to make a detailed plan and start writing code.

```bash
planto
```

or for short:

```bash
pdx
```

☁️ _If you're using Planto Cloud, you'll be prompted at this point to start a trial._

Then just give the REPL help text a quick read, and you're ready go.
